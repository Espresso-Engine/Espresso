## Branches
### Stable
The `stable` branch is for, well, the stable build which means it will only get PRs for bug fixes and necessary patches.
This means anything that fixes known bugs/vulnerabilites to Espresso or anything that makes its code more efficient without needing to be in the `next` branch.
### Next
This branch is for anything that doesn't fit in the stable branch, which includes any refactoring and feature additions.
When a new release is ready and has been tested to be stable, it merges with the `stable` branch and a new release is made.
